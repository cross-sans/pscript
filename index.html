	<h1>Pscript Documentation</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Pscript is a simple programming language designed for beginners to learn programming concepts. It is inspired by Python and uses a syntax similar to Python's.</p>

	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<p>To use Pscript, you will need a text editor to write your code and a Pscript compiler to convert your code to Python. You can download the Pscript compiler from the same profile you reached this pagge.</p>

	<h2>Syntax</h2>
	<p>Pscript uses a syntax similar to Python's, with a few differences:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Statements are separated by newlines.</li>
		<li>Indentation is used to define blocks of code.</li>
		<li>Variables are created using the "set" keyword.</li>
		<li>Arrays are created using the "arr" keyword.</li>
		<li>Functions are created using the "func" keyword.</li>
		<li>Messages can be printed to the console using the "&gt;:" and ":&lt;" delimiters or using print().</li>
		<li>Comments can be added using the "<<comment>>" syntax.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<p>Here are some examples of Pscript code:</p>
	<pre>
	
class main[]
	import numpy as np<<testing things on pscript and the code's translation into actual python code>>
	set name to input("what is your name? ")
	arr data => [2,4,5,1,6,7,4,35,63,2,3,5]
	set age to int(input("what is your age? "))
	print(f"hello {name}, you are {age} years old, nice to meet you")
	print(np.sort(data))
	print(f"{30 < 20} {30 > 20}")
end[]


	</pre>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Pscript is a simple programming language that can help beginners learn programming concepts. It is easy to learn and use, and can be a great stepping stone to more advanced languages.</p>
