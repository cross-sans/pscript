	<h1>Pscript Documentation</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Pscript is a simple programming language designed for beginners to learn programming concepts. It is inspired by Python and uses a syntax similar to Python's.</p>

	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<p>To use Pscript, you will need a text editor to write your code and a Pscript compiler to convert your code to Python. You can download the Pscript compiler from the same profile you reached this pagge.</p>

	<h2>Syntax</h2>
	<p>Pscript uses a syntax similar to Python's, with a few differences:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Statements are separated by newlines.</li>
		<li>Indentation is used to define blocks of code.</li>
		<li>Variables are created using the "set" keyword.</li>
		<li>Arrays are created using the "arr" keyword.</li>
		<li>Functions are created using the "func" keyword.</li>
		<li>Messages can be printed to the console using the "&gt;:" and ":&lt;" delimiters.</li>
		<li>Comments can be added using the "&lt;comment&gt;" syntax.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<p>Here are some examples of Pscript code:</p>
	<pre>
class main[]
    set name to input("What is your name? ")
    set age to int(input("What is your age? "))
    print(&gt;:"Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age) + " years old.":&lt;)
end[]
	</pre>
	<pre>
class main[]
    arr data =&gt; [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    func sum(arr):
        set total to 0
        for num in arr:
            set total to total + num
        endfor
        return total
    endfunc
    set result to sum(data)
    print(&gt;:"The sum of " + str(data) + " is " + str(result) + ".":&lt;)
end[]
	</pre>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Pscript is a simple programming language that can help beginners learn programming concepts. It is easy to learn and use, and can be a great stepping stone to more advanced languages.</p>
